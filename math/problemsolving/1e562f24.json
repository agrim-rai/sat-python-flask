  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice A is correct. It&rsquo;s given that the estimate for the proportion of the population that has the characteristic is <math alttext=\"0.49\"><mn>0.49</mn>\n</math> with an associated margin of error of <math alttext=\"0.04\"><mn>0.04</mn>\n</math>. Subtracting the margin of error from the estimate and adding the margin of error to the estimate gives an interval of plausible values for the true proportion of the population that has the characteristic. Therefore, it&rsquo;s plausible that the proportion of the population that has this characteristic is between <math alttext=\"0.45\"><mn>0.45</mn>\n</math> and <math alttext=\"0.53\"><mn>0.53</mn>\n</math>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice B is incorrect. A value less than <math alttext=\"0.45\"><mn>0.45</mn>\n</math> is outside the interval of plausible values for the proportion of the population that has the characteristic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice C is incorrect. The value <math alttext=\"0.49\"><mn>0.49</mn>\n</math> is an estimate for the proportion based on this sample. However, since the margin of error for this estimate is known, the most appropriate conclusion is not that the proportion is exactly one value but instead lies in an interval of plausible values.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice D is incorrect. A value greater than <math alttext=\"0.53\"><mn>0.53</mn>\n</math> is outside the interval of plausible values for the proportion of the population that has the characteristic.</p>",
