  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The correct answer is <math alttext=\"88\"><mn>88</mn>\n</math>. It's given that there are a total of <math alttext=\"275\"><mn>275</mn>\n</math> attendees and each attendee is assigned to either group A, group B, or group C. It's also given that if one of these attendees is selected at random, the probability of selecting an attendee who is assigned to group A is <math alttext=\"0.44\"><mn>0.44</mn>\n</math> and the probability of selecting an attendee who is assigned to group B is <math alttext=\"0.24\"><mn>0.24</mn>\n</math>. It follows that there are <math alttext=\"0.44 left parenthesis 275 right parenthesis\"><mn>0.44</mn><mfenced><mn>275</mn></mfenced></math>, or <math alttext=\"121\"><mn>121</mn>\n</math>, attendees who are assigned to group A and <math alttext=\"0.24 left parenthesis 275 right parenthesis\"><mn>0.24</mn><mfenced><mn>275</mn></mfenced></math>, or <math alttext=\"66\"><mn>66</mn>\n</math>, attendees who are assigned to group B. The number of attendees who are assigned to group C is the number of attendees who are not assigned to group A or group B. In other words, the number of attendees who are assigned to group C is the total number of attendees minus the number of attendees who are assigned to group A and group B. Therefore, the number of attendees who are assigned to group C is <math alttext=\"275 minus 121 minus 66\"><mn>275</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>121</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>66</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"88\"><mn>88</mn>\n</math>.</p>",
