  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice D is correct. It&rsquo;s given that at a movie theater, there are a total of <math alttext=\"350\"><mn>350</mn>\n</math> customers and that each customer is located in either theater A, theater B, or theater C. If the probability of selecting a customer in theater A is <math alttext=\"0.48\"><mn>0.48</mn>\n</math>, then <math alttext=\"left parenthesis 0.48 right parenthesis left parenthesis 350 right parenthesis\"><mfenced><mn>0.48</mn></mfenced><mfenced><mn>350</mn></mfenced></math>, or <math alttext=\"168\"><mn>168</mn>\n</math>, customers are located in theater A. If the probability of selecting a customer in theater B is <math alttext=\"0.24\"><mn>0.24</mn>\n</math>, then <math alttext=\"left parenthesis 0.24 right parenthesis left parenthesis 350 right parenthesis\"><mfenced><mn>0.24</mn></mfenced><mfenced><mn>350</mn></mfenced></math>, or <math alttext=\"84\"><mn>84</mn>\n</math>, customers are located in theater B.

Therefore, there are <math alttext=\"350 minus 252\"><mn>350</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>252</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"98\"><mn>98</mn>\n</math>, customers in theater C.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice A is incorrect. This is the percent, not the number, of the customers that are located in theater C.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of customers that are located in theater B, not theater C.</p>",
