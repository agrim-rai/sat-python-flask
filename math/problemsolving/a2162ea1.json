It's given that the estimate for the average weight of all boxes of oranges filled by the company in an <math alttext=\"8\"><mn>8</mn>\n</math>-hour period is <math alttext=\"23.1\"><mn>23.1</mn>\n</math> pounds, with an associated margin of error of <math alttext=\"0.19\"><mn>0.19</mn>\n</math> pounds.
