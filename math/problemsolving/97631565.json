  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice B is correct. It&rsquo;s given that from the sample of <math alttext=\"20\"><mn>20</mn>\n</math> employees at the company, <math alttext=\"16\"><mn>16</mn>\n</math> of the employees are enrolled in exactly three professional development courses this year. Since <math alttext=\"left parenthesis StartFraction 16 Over 20 EndFraction right parenthesis\"><mfenced><mfrac><mn>16</mn><mn>20</mn></mfrac></mfenced></math> is equal to <math alttext=\"0.80\"><mn>0.80</mn></math>, or&nbsp;<math alttext=\"StartFraction 80 Over 100 EndFraction\"><mfrac><mn>80</mn><mn>100</mn></mfrac></math>, it follows that <math alttext=\"80 percent sign\"><mn>80</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the employees in the sample are enrolled in exactly three professional development courses this year. Therefore, the best estimate for the percentage of employees at the company who are enrolled in exactly three professional development courses this year is <math alttext=\"80 percent sign\"><mn>80</mn><mo>%</mo></math>. It&rsquo;s given that there are a total of <math alttext=\"400\"><mn>400</mn>\n</math> employees at the company.
