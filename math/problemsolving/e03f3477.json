  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice B is correct. It's given that based on a sample selected at random, it's estimated that <math alttext=\"32 percent sign\"><mn>32</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows, with an associated margin of error of&nbsp;<math alttext=\"3.41 percent sign\"><mn>3.41</mn><mo>%</mo></math>. Subtracting the margin of error from the estimate and adding the margin of error to the estimate gives an interval of plausible values for the true percentage of adults who own televisions who use their televisions to watch nature shows. This means it's plausible that between <math alttext=\"32 percent sign minus 3.41 percent sign\"><mn>32</mn><mo>%</mo><mo>-</mo><mn>3.41</mn><mo>%</mo></math>, or&nbsp;<math alttext=\"28.59 percent sign\"><mn>28.59</mn><mo>%</mo></math>, and&nbsp;<math alttext=\"32 percent sign plus 3.41 percent sign\"><mn>32</mn><mo>%</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>3.41</mn><mo>%</mo></math>, or&nbsp;<math alttext=\"35.41 percent sign\"><mn>35.41</mn><mo>%</mo></math>, of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows. Therefore, of the given choices, the most plausible conclusion is that between&nbsp;<math alttext=\"28.59 percent sign\"><mn>28.59</mn><mo>%</mo></math> and&nbsp;<math alttext=\"35.41 percent sign\"><mn>35.41</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice C is incorrect. To make a plausible conclusion about all adults who own televisions, the sample must be selected at random from all adults who own televisions, not just those who use their televisions to watch nature shows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice D is incorrect. Since the sample was selected at random from all adults who own televisions, a plausible conclusion can be made about all adults who own televisions.</p>",
