  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The correct answer is <math alttext=\"4,205\"><mn>4,205</mn>\n</math>. The exterior surface area of a figure is the sum of the areas of all its faces. It's given that the box does not have a lid and that each side of the box is in the shape of a square. Therefore, the box consists of <math alttext=\"5\"><mn>5</mn>\n</math> congruent square faces. It's also given that the length of each edge is <math alttext=\"29\"><mn>29</mn>\n</math> inches. Let <math alttext=\"s\"><mi>s</mi>\n</math> represent the length of an edge of a square. It follows that the area of a square is equal to <math alttext=\"s squared\"><msup>\n\t<mi>s</mi>\n\t<mn>2</mn>\n</msup>\n</math>. Therefore, the area of each of the <math alttext=\"5\"><mn>5</mn>\n</math> square faces is equal to <math alttext=\"29 squared\"><msup><mn>29</mn><mn>2</mn></msup></math>, or <math alttext=\"841\"><mn>841</mn>\n</math>, square inches. Since the box consists of <math alttext=\"5\"><mn>5</mn>\n</math> congruent square faces, it follows that the sum of the areas of all its faces, or the exterior surface area of this box without a lid, is <math alttext=\"5 left parenthesis 841 right parenthesis\"><mn>5</mn><mfenced><mn>841</mn></mfenced></math>, or <math alttext=\"4,205\"><mn>4,205</mn>\n</math>, square inches.</p>",
