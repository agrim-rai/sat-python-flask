  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The correct answer is <math alttext=\"241\"><mn>241</mn>\n</math>. For a certain animal, it's given that a model predicts the animal weighed <math alttext=\"241\"><mn>241</mn>\n</math> pounds when it was born and gained <math alttext=\"3\"><mn>3</mn>\n</math> pounds per day in its first year of life. It's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form <math alttext=\"f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a plus b x\"><mi>f</mi><mfenced><mi>x</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>x</mi></math>, where <math alttext=\"f left parenthesis x right parenthesis\"><mi>f</mi><mfenced><mi>x</mi></mfenced></math> is the predicted weight, in pounds, of the animal <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi>\n</math> days after it was born, and <math alttext=\"a\"><mi>a</mi>\n</math> and <math alttext=\"b\"><mi>b</mi>\n</math> are constants. It follows that <math alttext=\"a\"><mi>a</mi>\n</math> represents the predicted weight, in pounds, of the animal when it was born and <math alttext=\"b\"><mi>b</mi>\n</math> represents the predicted rate of weight gain, in pounds per day, in its first year of life. Thus, the value of <math alttext=\"a\"><mi>a</mi>\n</math> is <math alttext=\"241\"><mn>241</mn>\n</math>.</p>",
