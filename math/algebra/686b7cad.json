  "rationale": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice A is correct. It's given that a radio show stated that <math alttext=\"3\"><mn>3</mn>\n</math> times as many people voted in favor of the proposal as people who voted against it. Let <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi>\n</math> represent the number of people who voted against the proposal. It follows that <math alttext=\"3 x\"><mrow>\n\t<mn>3</mn>\n\t<mi>x</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math> is the number of people who voted in favor of the proposal and <math alttext=\"3 x minus x\"><mn>3</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>x</mi></math>, or <math alttext=\"2 x\"><mrow>\n\t<mn>2</mn>\n\t<mi>x</mi>\n</mrow>\n</math>, is how many more people voted in favor of the proposal than voted against it. It's also given that a social media post reported that <math alttext=\"15,000\"><mn>15,000</mn>\n</math> more people voted in favor of the proposal than voted against it. Thus, <math alttext=\"2 x equals 15,000\"><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>15,000</mn></math>. Since <math alttext=\"2 x equals 15,000\"><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>15,000</mn></math>, the value of <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi>\n</math> must be half of <math alttext=\"15,000\"><mn>15,000</mn>\n</math>, or <math alttext=\"7,500\"><mn>7,500</mn>\n</math>. Therefore, <math alttext=\"7,500\"><mn>7,500</mn>\n</math> people voted against the proposal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice B is incorrect. This is how many more people voted in favor of the proposal than voted against it, not the number of people who voted against the proposal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of people who voted in favor of the proposal, not the number of people who voted against the proposal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.</p>",
